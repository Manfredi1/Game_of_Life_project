# LCP_Project

This project is a simulation of John Conway's Game of Life implemented trough a jupyter notebook. 
The project is divided into two part: the visualization that can be found in the Game.ipynb file, and the statistical part in STATISTICAL.ipynb<br>


In the **Game.ipynb** file we have implemented a pygame simulation that show the interaction between cells and a bunch of interesting information that can be deduced from it.<br>

In the **STATISTICAL.ipynb** file we show the result of different simulations that is stored in the Data folder.<br>

In the end we have some utility functions that we used in both files in the script **support.py**. A dictionary with some import figures as well as a function to store the information can be found in **organism.py**. The figures that we decided to put in that dictionary are the figures that appear at least one times on a thousand simulation. A full list of it can be found <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/List_of_common_oscillators">here</a> and <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/List_of_common_still_lifes">here</a>.<br>
