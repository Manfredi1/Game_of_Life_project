# LCP_Project

<p>This project is a simulation of John Conway's Game of Life implemented trough a jupyter notebook. 
The project is divided in two part: the visualization that can be found in the Game.ipynb file, and the statistical part in STATISTICAL.ipynb</p>


<p>In the Game.ipynb file we have implemented a pygame simulation that show the interaction between cells and a bunch of interesting information that can be deduced from it.</p>

<p>In the STATISTICAL.ipynb file we show the result of different simulation that is stored in the Data folder</p>

<p>In the end we have some utility functions that we used in both files in the script support.py. A dictionary with some import figures as well as a function to store the information can be found in organism.py</p>
