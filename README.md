# LCP_Project

This project is a simulation of John Conway's Game of Life implemented trough a jupyter notebook. 
The project is divided in two part: the visualization that can be found in the Game.ipynb file, and the statistical part in STATISTICAL.ipynb


In the Game.ipynb file we have implemented a pygame simulation that show the interaction between cells and a bunch of interesting information that can be deduced.

In the STATISTICAL.ipynb file we show the result of different simulation that is stored in the Data folder

In the end we have some utility functions that we used in both files in the script support.py. A dictionary with some import figures as well as a functionto store the information can be found in organism.py
